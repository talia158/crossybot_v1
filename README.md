# Autonomous Crossy Road Bot (version 1.0 - rough beta)

A Crossy Road Bot
- Fits a world grid onto every frame and classifies each lane
- Determines current map free space and velocity of borders to project game state into the future
- Uses collected data to determine whether to move forward or wait, with simple heuristics

Requires MSI App Player (window should be as small as possible and in the top left of the screen)

I have since realised flaws in this implementation, which I am attempting to fix in version 2.0
